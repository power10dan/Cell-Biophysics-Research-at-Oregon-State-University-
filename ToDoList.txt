Finish Peak Finding Testing, Put Peak Finding Algorithm In GUI. 

Updated 8/22/14

Crop image, make analysis on crop image

over plot found peak on original image

test code to make it commercial

reliability test 

Updated 8/29/14

Threshold image ( correlation map value under 1*x, where x is a user specified threshold, must be set to zero)

Sub-window analysis program integration

Over-plot peak map values to real image 

Continue testing code 

Updated 9/12/14

Make threshold 80 percent of maximum value in correlation map 
Add Buttons or Menu allow user to select between sub window or crop analysis
Objectives from 8/29/14 

Updated 9/22/14

Do Subwindow analysis port like PIV lab 

Imfuse function on image OK, since in a 8x8 image, we are only expecting there to be one line
