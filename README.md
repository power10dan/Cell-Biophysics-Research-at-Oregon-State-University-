My Computational Physics research work for the Cell Biophysics Research Group at Oregon State University 

The first version of the program is a line detection program written in Matlab. The version contains a very friendly
user interface. The program uses an algorithm developed by Professor Bo Sun and I that is able to use pattern recognition techniques and pixel voting to detect lines on images. It is because of this that the algorithm is able to detect lines even with noises on images present. In other words, noises or image defects would not hamper the ability for the algorithm to detect lines on the image. 

Future versions will include a center detection algorithm to detect the center on the correlation map and a fiber reconstruction algorithm that takes the identified peaks and reconstructs the line locations on a separate graph to better see how the lines are connected.
